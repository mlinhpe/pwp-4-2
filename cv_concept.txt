How would your own CV website look if there were no limitations regarding technical resources? 

Content 

- A page with general information, e.g. education, skill set, professional experience, certificates, 
contact information and a link to a git repo.  
- A page with a personal introduction and the resume√©. 
- Maybe a page with demos of the projects one has accomplished, like a portfolio. 

Display 

- For example, a list of programming languages or framworks can be linked to the respective git repo 
so that the visitor can have a better picture what kind of experience one has regarding a certain technology.  
- Also the demos can be linked to the git repo where the complete implementation can be found. 
- A graphic can be used to show the levels of the different skills. 
- Functionality that allows visitors to download the cv (Download Button) in case someone wants to print the cv 
to use it in a personal interview.  
- Maybe the visitor needs to enter an email address for downloading the cv, this way we can have more information about the visitor.  
- Add a QR code to the cv for the print version, so that one can easily find their way back to the website when needed. 

 What would be useful information to gather about people that visit your website?  

- How many people have visited the website 
- Where the visitors are located 
- When the website is visited (when it is visited the most often?) 
- Duration of the visits 
- Which links they clicked 
- How many people have downloaded the cv 
- How many people have scanned the QR code to get to the website 
- Mouse tracking to see at what point the user loses interest 

Techniques that can be used: 

- Implementation of a tracking pixel 
- Use cookies 
- Web analytics frameworks for monitoring user behavior
